# Doppleganger project
In this project, we will build a Fun Application - We will use the Face Embeddings to find a doppelganger or look-alike to a given person. Specifically, we will give you images of two persons and a celebrity dataset. Your task will be to find their celebrity look-alike. The first person is Sofia Solares who looks like the American Singer Selena Gomez and the second one is Shashikant Pedwal who looks like Indian Film Actor Amitabh Bachchan.
You simply need a dataset which has enough celebrity faces and use face embeddings to match the test image with the celebrity face embeddings

## The Dataset
There are many datasets that contain images of celebrities. Some of them are:

- CelebA Dataset
- VGGFace
- VGGFace2
- MS-Celeb-1M
- Celebrity-Together Dataset
